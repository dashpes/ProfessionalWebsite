### Step 3: Remove Old Git History
```bash

rm -rf .git

ls -la | grep .git  # Should show nothing
```

### Step 4: Initialize Fresh Repository
```bash
# Create brand new git repository
git init

# Check status (should show all files as untracked)
git status
```

### Step 5: Professional Initial Commit
```bash
# Add all files (sensitive files are already in .gitignore)
git add .

# Check what will be committed (verify no sensitive files)
git status

# Create professional initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Modern Next.js portfolio website
